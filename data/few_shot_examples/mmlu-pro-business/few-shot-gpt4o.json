    "question": "What is the effective rate of yield of a stock selling for $60 and paying an annual dividend of $2?\nA. 2(1/2)%\nB. 3(1/3)%\nC. 4%\nD. 5%",
    "solution": "The price of the stock is $60. The annual dividend paid is $2. The yield of a stock is calculated by dividing the annual dividend by the stock's price. Divide 2 by 60 to get the yield. The result is 0.0333, or 3.33%. This matches option B, which is 3(1/3)%. The answer is B. 3(1/3)%."

    "solution": "1. Calculate the actual return of the portfolio: \n   - Ending Value = $60,000\n   - Beginning Value = $50,000\n   - Actual Return = (Ending Value - Beginning Value) / Beginning Value = ($60,000 - $50,000) / $50,000 = $10,000 / $50,000 = 0.20 or 20%\n\n2. Calculate the expected return of the portfolio using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):\n   - Risk-free rate, Rf = 4% or 0.04\n   - Market return, Rm = 12% or 0.12\n   - Beta (\u03b2) of the portfolio = 1.8\n   - Expected Return = Rf + \u03b2(Rm - Rf) = 0.04 + 1.8(0.12 - 0.04) = 0.04 + 1.8(0.08) = 0.04 + 0.144 = 0.184 or 18.4%\n\n3.

    "solution": "First, understand the problem. You have a loan with a 6% annual interest rate, and the interest charge is $36. The loan is for 90 days.\n\nConvert the annual interest rate to the period of the loan:\n\nAnnual rate: 6%, which is 0.06 as a decimal.\n\nCalculate the interest rate for 90 days. There are about 365 days in a year, so the loan period in fraction of a year is 90/365.\n\nCalculate the effective interest rate for 90 days as: 0.06 * (90/365).\n\nInterest is given by the formula: Interest = Principal * Rate.\n\nYou know Interest is $36 and Rate is 0.06 * (90/365).\n\nNow solve for Principal:\n\n36 = Principal * (0.06 * (90/365)).\n\nCalculate the rate: 0.06 * (90/365) = 0.0147945.\n\nUse the rate to find Principal: 36 = Principal * 0.0147945.\n\nSolve for Principal: Principal = 36 / 0.0147945.\n\nPrincipal \u2248 2433.89.\n\nCompare this with the options.

Observational learning.\nE. Cognitive learning.\nF. Classical conditioning.\nG. Sensory learning.\nH. Habituation.\nI. Latent learning.\nJ. Behavioural learning.",
    "solution": "Giving free perfume samples in magazines is meant to associate the pleasant smell with the product. This uses a desired stimulus to encourage a positive reaction or behavior towards buying the product, similar to how a neutral stimulus is paired with an unconditioned stimulus to elicit a response in classical conditioning. Classical conditioning involves creating an association between a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus to produce a conditioned response. \n\nThe answer is F. Classical conditioning."
