    "solution": "First, we replace n with 11 in the expression n + 6. So, n + 6 becomes 11 + 6. The sum of 11 and 6 is 17. Now, we evaluate the expression 10 - (n + 6). We have 10 - 17. The result of 10 - 17 is -7. Therefore, the answer is D, which is -7. \n\nThe answer is D."

    "question": "Which of the following statements about the correlation coefficient is true?\nA. A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect cause-and-effect relationship between the variables.\nB. A correlation of -1 indicates a perfect cause-and-effect relationship between the variables.\nC. The correlation coefficient is always less than 0.\nD. Correlation applies equally well to quantitative and categorical data.\nE. The correlation coefficient and the slope of the regression line are always equal.\nF. The correlation coefficient and the slope of the regression line may have opposite signs.\nG. Correlations of +0.87 and -0.87 indicate the same degree of clustering around the regression line.\nH. A correlation of 0 indicates a strong positive relationship between the variables.",
    "solution": "A correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two quantitative variables. A correlation of 1 or -1 indicates a perfect linear relationship, not a cause-and-effect relationship. The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1. It is suitable for quantitative data, not categorical data. The slope of the regression line and the correlation can have opposite signs if the scales of the variables are different, but usually they have the same sign if variables are standardized. The degree of clustering, or strength, is determined by the absolute value of the correlation coefficient. Zero correlation does not imply a strong positive relationship; it indicates no linear relationship. Therefore, statement G is true because correlations +0.87 and -0.87 reflect the same clustering strength but opposite directions. The answer is G."
