    "question": "While a person is walking, his arms swing through approximately a 45\u00b0 angle in 0.5s.As a reasonable approximation, we can assume that the arm moves with constant speed during each swing. A typical arm is 70.0 cm long, measured from the shoulder joint. What is the acceleration (in metre per second squared) of a 1.0 g drop of blood in the fingertips at the bottom of the swing?\nA. 1.22\nB. 2.45\nC. 1.95\nD. 3.00\nE. 1.50\nF. 1.73\nG. 0.98\nH. 2.00\nI. 3.50\nJ. 2.90",
    "solution": "1. The arm swings through a 45\u00b0 angle, which is equivalent to \u03c0/4 radians.\n2. The arm length is 70.0 cm, or 0.7 meters.\n3. The arc distance swung by the arm is the product of the angle and the radius: arc = radius \u00d7 angle = 0.7 \u00d7 \u03c0/4 \u2248 0.55 meters.\n4. The swing time is 0.5 seconds, so the speed is distance/time: speed = 0.55/0.5 = 1.1 m/s.\n5. The acceleration of the drop of blood at the bottom of the swing is centripetal: \\(a = v^2/r\\).\n6. Substitute values: \\(a = (1.1)^2/0.7 \u2248 1.73 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\).\n\nThe answer is F. 1.73"

    "solution": "1. Use Snell's Law at the boundary of water and the prism: n1 * sin(i) = n2 * sin(r), where n1 = refractive index of water = 1.33, n2 = refractive index of the prism = 1.66.\n2. For minimum deviation, the angle of incidence i equals the angle of emergence e, and the refraction angle within the prism is r = A/2, where A is the apex angle.\n3. The angle within the prism, using the apex angle: A = 72 degrees, so r = A/2 = 36 degrees.\n4. From Snell's Law with n1 * sin(i) = n2 * sin(r), we get 1.33 * sin(i) = 1.66 * sin(36 degrees).\n5.
